This is a semi-dry preparation featuring the star ingredient okra pods (bhindi in Hindi), piquant onions, tangy tomatoes, bold Indian spices and herbs. It is one of the most popular dishes served in almost all restaurants too, of North India. My Bhindi Masala Recipe is an easy and delicious Punjabi style preparation, which is also vegan, gluten-free and quite wholesome.","title":"Bhindi Masala","photo":"bhindi-masala","chefID":"655ce2b8b34626526079aa56","__v":0},
